# Connect4

## The repository
This is the repository of a Connect4 game developed in C by our team, BitsNBytes.
The first stage of our project is to implement the game and its interface, allowing two human players to play in the terminal. The second stage consists of developing a bot that plays against a human player or against another bot. The bot will have multiple difficulty settings.
